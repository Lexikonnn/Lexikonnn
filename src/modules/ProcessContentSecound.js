                During the development, I utilized component-based architecture and React hooks, enabling efficient state management and code reusability.
                Additionally, I implemented animations and a responsive, modern design, ensuring the application is both attractive and functional across all devices.
                I am confident that this project clearly illustrates my knowledge and readiness to tackle complex problems in front-end application development.
